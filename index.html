      <h1>GSC Drone Lab 1: Introduction</h1>
      <span class="readTime UPDATE">&#9200; Length: 3 minutes, 35 seconds (~730 words)</span>
      <p>
       This lab is the <b>first</b> in a series of labs designed to demonstrate how several IBM technologies, such as <span class="blue">OpenShift (Kubernetes), Hybrid Multicloud, and CP4i (API Connect)</span> can be utilized along with
       modern industry devices, such as <span class="darkblue">drones</span> and <span class="darkblue">sensors</span>, in various industry-specific applications.
      </p>

      <p>
       With much to cover, it’s imperative that you start out by <b>learning about your environment</b> and <b>get comfortable</b> with the environment’s interface <b>configuration</b>. You don’t need to be a technically-skilled expert to
       customize or even deploy your first application to a multi-hybrid cloud – follow these instructions carefully and you’ll be able to do just that!
      </p>

      <p>
       As a lab participant, you will have the opportunity to review and <b>change configuration</b> in an application thereby making it <span class="magenta">unique</span> to you, access RedHat OpenShift through IBM Cloud, use a
       <b>Dockerfile</b> to connect your unique application’s code repository on <b>GitHub</b> to an <b>OpenShift</b> instance, and even get to play around with your new application as well.
      </p>

      <p>The diagram on the right depicts a high-level flow and services used in this lab.</p>

      <h2>Lab Overview</h2>

      <p>
       At the core of this lab, you will deploy a web application (just like most sites you’d access online) to a hybrid multi-cloud. As an example, you will use a prepared <b>remote drone operations console</b> as your web application,
       which you’ll be able to add your own custom and unique configuration.
      </p>

      <p>
       Drones are quickly growing in popularity, both in commercial and industry usage. In this lab, you’ll experience firsthand some cross-industry examples of drone technology being put to task at
       <b>saving lives</b> and <b>helping populations</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
       While you will not be writing the code for your remote drone application, you will gain some <b>insight</b> on the <b>process</b>, and even make <b>small code changes</b> in <b>GitHub Enterprise</b> that will render your application
       unique.
      </p>

      <p>
       You will then deploy your remote drone application on <b>OpenShift</b>, an <b>open source application platform</b> based on Kubernetes and container technology that focuses on making the
       <b>Kubernetes</b> experience easier for developers and operations teams. With a menu driven interface, users can create a highly available and managed OpenShift cluster, along with industry-leading developer experience, automated provisioning, updates, and patching.
      </p>

      <p>
       Along the way, you will learn about the IBM Hybrid Multicloud <b>Sandbox as a Service (SBaaS)</b> platform which provides cloud services to enable our technical sellers to gain experience with IBM Cloud capabilities along with other
       industry Cloud platforms in a hands-on environment. Pre-packaged scenarios and technologies can be customized to build client specific PoCs/prototypes and show the value of IBM Cloud and Industry solutions to help clients with their
       cloud and digital transformation journeys.

      <h2>What steps were done for each lab user as setup?</h2>

      <p>
       When you made a request to take this hands-on lab, there were some background tasks that were performed on your behalf in order to prepare the GitHub and Sandbox as a Service (SBaaS) environments with the appropriate permissions,
       configuration, and content. Using the <span class="tblue">GitHub Collaborator API, IBM Cloud CLI, and OpenShift CLI</span>, the following tasks were completed for each new lab user:
      </p>

      <p>
       <b>Setting up the GitHub Repository for the user</b>
       <br />
       A <span class="tblue">clone</span> was created from the original GitHub repository where the remote drone console application was developed, and reuploaded to a new unique space for a given lab user. That user was then added to their unique GitHub repository as a <span class="tblue">collaborator</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
       <b>Adding the user to the SBaaS environment</b>
       <br />
       The new user was first given <span class="tblue">user permissions</span> to the existing <span class="tblue">IBM Cloud organization</span> for the <span class="tblue">SBaaS environment</span> that was provisioned for the lab. A new
       <span class="tblue">project</span> was then created specifically for that user in the <span class="tblue">OpenShift cluster</span> within that organization, and <span class="tblue">user policies</span> applied to enable the rights
       necessary for completion of the lab steps.
      </p>

      <p>
       <b>Build/Deploy an instance of the application</b>
       <br />
       From within OpenShift, the remote drone application code was then <span class="tblue">pulled</span> from the <span class="tblue">GitHub</span> repository to <span class="tblue">build a container image</span> from the <span class="tblue">Dockerfile</span>. That container image was then pushed to the appropriate <span class="tblue">namespace</span> in the OpenShift Container Registry running on IBM Cloud in this SBaaS environment to deploy the application. This initial application instance was deployed as a reference/example, but each lab user will create and customize a second application instance as part of the lab activities that follow.

        In this section, you will navigate to GitHub Enterprise and access the code for your application. IBM has GitHub Enterprise which provides the <b>social coding experience</b> that developers love. In most development environments,
        there’s a lot of collaboration involved regarding code and changes to code. Enabling a team of developers to manage these changes and subsequent versions requires some form of source control, or git. <br />
        In this lab, you will gain some <b>insight on the process</b>, and even make <b>small code changes</b> that will render your application unique.

        GitHub Enterprise includes the same great set of features as GitHub.com but packaged for running on IBM’s network. All repository data is stored on machines that you control, and access is integrated with IBM’s authentication system
        (SAML). GitHub Enterprise also includes support for pre-receive hooks, a powerful tool that can help you enforce critical business rules, meet compliance requirements and help prevent other undesired changes from ever being made.
        Use GitHub Enterprise when you need complete control over repository and project information. Visit

           Let’s review the code repository’s structure. Every application has source code which is stored in a <b>repository</b>. A repository contains a set of files, as well as the history of changes made to those files.
        </p>
       <p>
           Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – <b>anything your project needs</b>. At the top level, you notice <b>public</b> and <b>src</b> folders, followed by a set of files. These files typically contain a <b>README.md</b> and can also include licensing info, contributors, deployment configuration, etc. You may even notice that the README.md is open for viewing <b>below</b> the files/folders, where you can learn some facts about this application.
       </p>
       <p>
           The public folder often contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to set the page title. You can also add other assets to the public folder, as is the case for this lab repository, where there are some configuration files that allow customization of certain aspects of the user interface. Visit <a href="https://github.com/kmindi/special-files-in-repository-root/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">https://github.com/kmindi/special-files-in-repository-root/blob/master/README.md</a> for more information on typical files you’d find in any repository and <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure/" target="_blank">https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure/</a> to learn more about the use of the <b>public</b> and <b>src</b> folder in React development.

            What you’re seeing in this repository is the <b><i>source code</i></b> for the remote drone console application, which was built using <b>React</b> (a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces), TypeScript (an open-source programming language with a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript which adds optional static typing), and <b>Node JS</b> (an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment). The application provides users with an interface to connect to a defined set of drones in order to assist users by leveraging services like aerial surveillance, inspection of infrastructures, first responders coordination, geothermal exploration, etc. for different industries. The dashboard provides users with drone operation statistics and other drone related information to effectively monitor, optimize and control the drones.

           Many developers do not edit code on GitHub directly. Instead, they use a range of different Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and code editors like Visual Studio Code, XCode, Eclipse, etc. Then, developers use tools like GitHub Desktop, SourceTree or git commands on a command line to push code changes and commits to the remote code repository. <b>However</b>, for this lab, you will edit directly within the <b>GitHub web interface</b> to avoid installing these programs.      
       </p>
       <p>
            Let’s edit the code in the <span class="magenta">config.json</span> file, your application’s <b>configuration file</b>, which adds customization to your application’s <b>user interface</b>.

            To understand the relationship between GitHub and the deployment environment (in this case, OpenShift), you will see your changes from this step after you have deployed the application in later steps.  As it is not plausible to have a lab user build their own application entirely in a limited time frame, making this simple change is meant to exemplify how code changes can propagate throughout the lifecycle of application development and deployment. <b>In later steps</b>, you will reference this change by having the option to view an already deployed instance of the default original application.

            In some later example screenshots, you might see that the word <span class="blue">"Walkthrough"</span> was added in front of “<span class="blue">Remote Operations Console</span>”. <b>Any name or phrase</b> (like the name of your pet, your name, etc.) are options for ConsoleDisplayName. 🙂 For reference, you will later see this phrase at the <b><i>top</i></b> of your Remote Drone Dashboard application.

        <p>
            <span class="yellow">Be careful!</span> Any value you change for a field should contain <b>only alphanumeric characters and/or spaces</b>. Keep your values to <b>under 16 characters total</b>, but <b>at least one</b> character.

           You may edit the values for the fields “friendly_name” and “drone_serial_no” as well (the <span class="friendlyCode"><b>bolded</b></span> values below), and the changes will later be reflected in the application.

            Currently, you are editing directly on the master branch. The <b>master</b> branch is the <b>default</b> branch that your repository starts out with. As you continuously edit your code on your branch, those changes are reflected as <b><i>commits</i></b>.

        </p>
        <p>
            A situation could occur when you want to create <b><i>different versions</i></b> of your application - for example, when adding a new feature to the current code, you do not want to interfere with the version that others may be working on. Creating these versions are called <b><i>branches</i></b> – you could create a <b><i>new_feature branch</i></b> that is based on the <b><i>master branch</i></b>. Once satisfied with code changes in the new branch, the new_feature branch could then <b><i>be merged</i></b> into the master branch for all collaborators to use as their working copy.

            It is important to be specific when writing the <span class="magenta">titles</span> and <span class="magenta">description</span> of code commits.

            As mentioned before, prior to when you began this lab, you were given user permissions to the existing <span class="blue">IBM Cloud</span> <b>organization</b> for the <span class="blue">SBaaS (Sandbox as a Service)</span> environment that was provisioned for this lab. A new project was created specifically for you in the OpenShift cluster within that organization, with all the necessary user policies.
           </p>

           <p>
               In this section, you will navigate from the <b>IBM Cloud dashboard</b> within that organization to the provisioned <b>IBM Sandbox as a Service</b> workspace. Then, you will access a <b>cluster</b> and open the <b>RedHat OpenShift</b> web console. In addition to exploring the RedHat OpenShift interface on IBM Cloud, you’ll also get an overview of the capabilities that OpenShift provides.
           </p>
           <p>
               <span class="tmagenta">Before you move on</span>, you may want a refresher on what exactly <span class="blue">Red Hat® OpenShift®</span> is. Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud™ is a managed offering to create your own OpenShift cluster of hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. <b>OpenShift is essentially a layer that's built on top of Kubernetes</b>, and makes working with it much easier: by taking a lot of the difficult tasks (like deploying applications and doing things like day-to-day operations) and building a web console in the CLI, as well as a <b><i>facade</i></b> on top of Kubernetes to make all of those tasks more streamlined and easier to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="./img/container_architecture.png" class="sideImage_txt"/>
                <span class="tmagenta">Let’s take a moment to review some concepts you will be delving into in the next few steps.</span> Consider the remote drone dashboard application you helped develop by editing in the <b>previous step</b>. You do your work on your laptop and if your dashboard had real life usage and contained a suite of various real-time systems and technologies, your environment might have a <b>specific configuration</b>. Other developers may have slightly <b>different configurations</b>. The application you’re developing relies on that configuration and is dependent on specific libraries, dependencies, and files. Meanwhile, your team has development and production environments which are standardized with their own configurations and their own sets of supporting files. You want to emulate those environments as much as possible locally, but without all of the <b>overhead</b> of recreating the server environments. So, how do you make your app work <b><i>across these environments</i></b>, pass quality assurance, and get your app deployed without massive headaches, rewriting, and break-fixing? The answer: <span class="blue">containers</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>container</b> that holds your application has the necessary libraries, dependencies, and files so that you can move it through production without all of the nasty side effects. Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single unit that can run as a resource-isolated process on a server. To run your app in Kubernetes on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, you must first <b>containerize</b> your app by creating a container image that you store in a container registry. Container image distribution is agile, small, and portable, and is <b>a lot easier</b> than installing new copies of operating systems – which is an ideal outcome for all.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the coming steps, you will take your <b>containerized</b> remote drone dashboard <b>application</b> and run it on RedHat OpenShift, which is a <b>Kubernetes</b> deployment that manages container images. It can be easy to confuse the two, but RedHat OpenShift and Kubernetes are different – to put it simply, Kubernetes is the <b>"kernel"</b> of distributed systems, while OpenShift is the <b>“distribution”</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that you have been refreshed on what OpenShift and its related components are, <span class="tmagenta">there’s an important distinction between the process outlined in this lab, versus other common processes of deployment on OpenShift, which will be outlined in the next steps.</span> <b>For now, let’s start out by exploring the IBM Cloud dashboard and OpenShift interface.</b>

Worker nodes are managed by a <b><i>master</i></b> that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster. So when you deploy the resources for a containerized app, the Kubernetes master decides which worker node to deploy those resources on, accounting for the deployment requirements and available capacity in the cluster. Kubernetes resources include services, deployments, and pods.

            <div class="answer">
                The Developer perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:
                <ul>
                <li>Create and deploy applications on OpenShift Container Platform by <b>importing existing codebases</b>, images, and <b>Dockerfiles</b></li>
                <li>Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status</li>
                <li>Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.</li>
                <li>Integrate serverless capabilities</li>
                </ul>
                The Administrator perspective lets you manage and set up the components that your team needs to run your apps, such as projects for your workloads, networking, and operators for integrating IBM, Red Hat, 3rd party, and custom services into the cluster.

                <p>The preferred mechanism for accessing a private Git repository is to use an SSH connection and a repository SSH key. However, you will use personal access tokens to allow OpenShift to access your private repository.</p>
                <p><b>Personal access tokens</b> are an <b>alternative</b> to the password you would use when accessing your account on the Git repository hosting service. You can think of personal access tokens as “house keys” to letting whoever has the key go into your house, or in this case your repository, and view it. You can designate your “house key” to have <b><i>predefined privileges</i></b> such as only letting the person who has that key enter your house - but do nothing when they’re inside of it. Or, the owner of the key can enter the house and do anything the owner of the house can.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    The preferred mechanism for accessing a private Git repository is to use an SSH connection and a repository SSH key. A repository SSH key, however, can only be used where the OpenShift cluster doesn't have access via an SSH connection blocked by a firewall. Being blocked by a firewall might occur if you're running an on-premise OpenShift cluster behind a corporate firewall, but using a Git hosting service such as GitHub (which is the case in this lab with GitHub Enterprise needing IBM SSO authentication first). The main reason the lab instructions detail token path is because that can be created easily from the browser. 
                    GitHub instructions for making an SSH key are CLI. You can use SSH keys for IBM GitHub Enterprise. In the case of SSH connections being blocked, it is necessary to fallback to using a personal access token and an HTTPS connection.                     
                </div>
                <p>
                    Any number of access tokens can be created, and you can create separate tokens for each separate client you may want to use to access your account. By using a separate token per client you can <b>control</b> what <b>level of access</b> each has, including whether they have <b>read-only access</b>, or can <b>update repositories</b>. A token for a specific client can be <b>revoked</b> without affecting other clients. Although what actions a specific client can do can be controlled, it would still be able to see all repositories that you as a user has access to.

            </h1>
            <p>In this section, you will explore what became of the application you added in the previous step and explore the post build process for your application.</p>
            <p>A <span class="darkblue">build</span> is the process of <b>transforming input parameters</b> into a <b>resulting object</b>. In this case, the process is used to transform input parameters of source code into a <b>runnable image</b>. The OpenShift Container Platform build system provides extensible support for build strategies that are based on selectable types specified in the build API. There are <span class="darkblue">three primary build strategies available</span>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Docker build</li>
                <li>Source-to-Image (S2I) build</li>
                <li>Custom build</li>
            </ol> 
            <p>In previous steps, we used the strategy involving a <span class="darkblue">Docker build</span> <span class="tdarkblue">using a Dockerfile</span>. The Docker build strategy invokes the docker build command and it expects a repository with a Dockerfile and all required artifacts in it to produce the runnable image.</p>
            <p>You will soon monitor the build status and build finish, and finally access the instantiated application.</p>

            <p>Log files are important because they keep track of events in your application from creation, modification, and deletion. Look for a prompt that refers to a <span class="magenta">successful authentication</span> using your <b>username</b> and <b>Personal Access Token</b>.</p>

                <p><b>Let’s review what we accomplished in this lab overall:</b> </p>
                
                <p>First, we got some exposure to <b>GitHub</b>, got a peek under the covers of the code layout and configuration for a sample Remote Drone Console Application, and set up a <b>Personal access token</b> with repository access permissions.</p>  
                
                <p>Next, we got familiar with navigating within our IBM Cloud account dashboard, and more specifically within an organization workspace, cluster, and it’s associated  RedHat <b>OpenShift</b> console. Within the OpenShift console, we worked on a project within the Developer perspective and added a new <b>Topology</b> to create an application from our GitHub’s <b>Dockerfile</b>.</p>  
                
                <p>Then, we explored the <b>Resources</b> within the <b>OpenShift</b> project <b>Topology</b> to monitor the application build process and to find the path the Remote Drone Console Application after its <b>deployment</b>.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, we explored the Remote Drone Console Application, confirmed our custom <b>configuration</b>, and considered <b>industry</b> use cases.</p>
                
                <p>As a takeaway, hopefully you feel a little more comfortable with the relationship between <b>GitHub</b> and RedHat <b>OpenShift</b> on <b>IBM Cloud</b>, and gained a better understanding of the overall process to take an application from code/configuration all the way to through to its containerized cloud deployment!</p> </div>
